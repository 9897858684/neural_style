Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a deep learning technique that combines the content of one image with the style of another to create a visually compelling artistic output.

This project uses a pretrained VGG19 network to extract content and style representations from images and generate a new image that blends them.

# Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a deep learning technique that blends two images:
Content Image: The image you want to transform.
Style Image: The image that provides the artistic style (like brush strokes, color patterns).

NST uses a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (usually VGG19) to extract and separate:

Content features from deep layers.

Style features from shallower layers.

The algorithm then iteratively generates a new image that:

Preserves the content of the content image.

Mimics the style of the style image.

 How It Works
1.Load a pretrained VGG19 model.

2.Pass the content and style images through the model to extract their respective features.

3.Define content loss and style loss using the extracted features.

4.Optimize a target image (starting as a copy of the content image or white noise) using gradient descent to minimize the combined loss.

 Key Concepts
Content Image: The photo or image whose structure you want to preserve.

Style Image: The artwork or image whose texture, color, and patterns you want to apply.

Output Image: A stylized version of the content image, rendered in the visual style of the style image.
